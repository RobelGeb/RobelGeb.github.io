            <p>The circuit was powered with 5V through USB and I used the red, green and RGB LEDs included in our kits.</p>
            <p>I used 220 ohm resistors for all of the LEDs I used because they were either 1.8V(R/G) or 3.3V(B) and they</p>
            <p>needed to run at 30mA or less. For the button I used a 10k ohm resistor.</p>

            <h2>Firmware running the lights and button!</h2>
            <p>
                <code>
                    const int
                    hello 
                    void setup () {
                        //initialized
                    }
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>The firmware used to control the lights was programmed in Arduino! I initialized the pins as outputs and</p>
            <p>the button as an input because it waits for a press to close the circuit. I programmed the LEDs to turn on</p>
            <p>when the button is pressed, where they turn on one at a time (from left to right) and the RGB light fades</p>
            <p>from red to green, creating a wave effect.</p>
