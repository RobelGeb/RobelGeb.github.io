            <p>The circuit was powered with 5V through USB and I used the LCD screen, photoresistor, and potentiometer from our kits.</p>
            <p>I used a 220 ohm resistor for the LCD screen and a 10K ohm resistor for the potentiometer and photoresistor. The</p>
            <p>potentiometer controls the contrast ratio of the LCD display and the photoresistor controls the message on the screen.</p>

            <p>
                <code>
                    const int
                    hello 
                    void setup () {
                        //initialized
                    }
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>The firmware used to control the lights was programmed in Arduino! I initialized the pins as outputs and</p>
            <p>the button as an input because it waits for a press to close the circuit. I programmed the LEDs to turn on</p>
            <p>when the button is pressed, where they turn on one at a time (from left to right) and the RGB light fades</p>
            <p>from red to green, creating a wave effect.</p>
