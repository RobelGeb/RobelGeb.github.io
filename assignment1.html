            <p>The circuit was powered with 5V through USB and I used the red, green and blue LEDs included in our kits.</p>
            <p>Since the red and green LEDs have a 1.8V drop and they run at 20mA, I used 100 ohm resistors for both. </p>
            <p>Similarly, the blue LED has a 3.3V drop and a 220 ohm resistor was used.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The firmware used to control the lights was programmed in Arduino! I used a loop to initialize the pins</p>
            <p>corresponding to each LED, then programmed them to quickly turn off and on individually 5 times before</p>
            <p>finally turning all on at once, then all turning off.</p>
