            <p>The circuit was powered with a 9V battery through the Vin pin and the modules I used are the FQP 30N06 MOSFET</p>
            <p>transistor, a diode, a 10k Ohm resistor an IR sensor and remote, and a DC motor + fan combo.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am unable to find a solution on how to work both the IR sensor and DC motor at the same time.</p>
            <p>They seem to be interfering with each other, so the motor will not turn on as long as the IR sensor is active.</p>

            <p>I programmed my arduino to use a motion sensor to turn on a small motor when it detected any motion. It also outputs </br>
                a message every time it detects movement. To calibrate the motion sensor I allowed it to wait for 30 seconds (recommended</br>
                 time is 30-60 sec) and then tested it once the time was complete.
